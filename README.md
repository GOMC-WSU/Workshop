# Workshop
This repository provides example and instruction to learn about GOMC and its capabilities to perform adsorption simulation and free energy calculation.
In each directory, there is a README.txt or pdf file to instruct the user.

Before start doing the worksho, User must add the `GOMC_CPU_GCMC` and `GOMC_CPU_NVT` binary to their path.
In addition to GOMC binary files, user must add the `pakcmol` binary to their path.

The order of performing the workshop is as follow:

1. adsorption/AR_IRMOF1
2. adsorption/CO2_IRMOF1
3. freeEnergy/NE
4. freeEnergy/AR
5. freeEnergy/KR
